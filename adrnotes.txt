To get librarians from csv:

1) read csv into R (done - sunshine <- read.csv("sunshine.csv")
2) something like -- librarian-sunshine <- sunshine$Job.Title("librarian"), something with a regex of course
3) ????

DISREGARD ABOVE, this is method:
librarians <- sunshine[grep("Librarian", sunshine$Job.Title, perl=TRUE), ]
#nts : figure out WHY that comma? fuck
#comma with blank means "Select All Columns", it's like a wildcard. Try putting in a *specific* column to see how it changes.
#new nts: figure out how to display multiple columns (but not ALL columns) for a search. Can we get just first and last names?
(then do same trick on librarians to get employer via something like:
mcmaster_librarians <- librarians[grep("Mcmaster University", librarians$Employer, perl=TRUE)]
(this is from https://stackoverflow.com/questions/19081613/r-need-to-subset-a-data-frame-using-matches-from-a-regex-expression)

To convert string salaries into numeric, something like:
sunshine$Salary <- parse_number(sunshine$Salary)
(note: I think this depends on library(readr) being active)


PROJECT IDEAS:

Simple: Count the number of librarians for each institution, output like: York: 50, Ryerson: 20, Mac: 10 or something like that
dim(librarians[grep("York", librarians$Employer, perl=TRUE) ,]) returns rows + columns. Probably a more elegant way to get just rows.

Next: plot that. Either ggplot2 or native. X axis = employers, Y axis = number.
